When reporting a bug make sure the ticket contains the following info:

1. Specific conditions.

   2. The particular CLI command.

      *Leave only the essential things to reproduce: try to check if possible if the bug is reproducible using
 single local storage driver, different concurrency level, item data size, etc.*

   3. The scenario file used.

      *Note that the default scenario is used implicitly. Please don't clutter with large bedsheet scenario files. Simplify the scenario leaving only the essential things.*

2. Expected behavior.

   *Specifying the reference to the particular documentation part describing the expected behavior would be great.*

3. Observed behavior.

   *Error message, errors.log output file, etc.*
